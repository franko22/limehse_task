infrastructure as Code
- What is it?
IaC enables infrastructure/operation/devops teams to no longer manually configure servers, provisioning
and modifying their configuration directly but using code instead.

- Why is it?
1) It enables scalability through the code to create or provisioning servers rapidly.
2) Reduces errors through the use of immutable servers, meaning modifications are made as code
3) It makes testing environments easier without affecting production environments for greenfield and bluefield approach.

- Are they any alternatives?
Yes they are, Ansible, Pelumi, Biceps and Clouformation is one of such alternatives

- Observability
In a microservice architecture, it's very important to collect metrics, enable tracing for debugging,
and logs for application specifics to enhance developer productivity. We can solve most of applications issues with tracing and application logs.

I will check IAM policies, WAF and IDS systems.
